$$$$$$ HEH BOT $$$$$$

Idea of bot is to have a heh count for individual users

* When a user says heh in any variation bot logs that count to the user
*when called it responds with Hi-score style with most hehs to least
*level of degeneracy bases on score?

??????? Future Things?  ????????
# I should seperate each individual bot command to seperate files to keep the code cleaner and bring them all into the one app file
# I should set up the DB to save the server ID so that user/message data is saved into different sub clusters

issues // Bugs
Hiscore needs to be finished

Additional Requests
# random 5% chance to trigger the bot to say 'heh' on user messages
# random 1% chance to trigger bot response of: "Heh isn't something you throw out lightly. It is a cold dark phrase that destroys the humanity of a child's wonder. No one knows why heh was necessary, but we do know that your opinions do not matter. They will not matter and in the game of life, you have lost."
instead of 'nice'
# bot counter?
