$$$$$$ HEH BOT $$$$$$

Idea of bot is to have a heh count for individual users

* When a user says heh in any variation bot logs that count to the user
*when called it responds with Hi-score style with most hehs to least
*level of degeneracy bases on score?

??????? Future Things?  ????????
# I should seperate each individual bot command to seperate files to keep the code cleaner and bring them all into the one app file
# I should set up the DB to save the server ID so that user/message data is saved into different sub clusters
# Refactor the hiscore function


Additional Requests
# bot counter?
